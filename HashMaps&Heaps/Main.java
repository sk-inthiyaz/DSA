/*
You are given a 2D grid of size rows x cols. A robot (or a point) is placed 
at a starting position (row, col) within the grid.

The robot can move in 8 possible directions:
Up-Left
Up
Up-Right
Left
Right
Down-Left
Down
Down-Right
Your task is to print the new position after moving one step in each of the 8 directions.
If the new position goes out of the grid boundaries, print "Out of bounds" for that direction.

00 01 02
