2. Two Sum
This is one of the most famous interview questions and a perfect demonstration of why HashMaps are so powerful.
Problem: Given an array of integers nums and a target integer target, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
Example
Input: nums = [2, 7, 8, 15], target = 10
Output: [0, 2] (because nums[0] + nums[1] == 10)

    //     HashMap<Integer,Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
    //     for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
    //         if(arr.get(i)+arr.get(i+1)==target){
    //             hm.put(i, arr.get(i));
    //             hm.put(i+1, arr.get(i+1));

1. Count Frequency of Characters in a String
This is the most classic "hello world" problem for HashMaps.

Problem: Given a string, create a map that stores each character and its frequency (how many times it appears).

Example:

Input: "hello world"

Output: {d=1, r=1, w=1, o=2, l=3, h=1, e=1, ' '=1} (order doesn't matter)

Logic: Iterate through the string character by character. For each character, check if it's already a key in your HashMap.

If it is, increment its value (the count).

If it isn't, add it to the map with a value of 1.
